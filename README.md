# Overview
* This repository contains code implementations for common backend Java interview questions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive reference for practicing and understanding fundamental data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

# Structure
* Data Structures: Implementations of core data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
* Algorithms: Examples of sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and other algorithmic paradigms.
* Design Patterns: Implementations of common design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.
* System Design: Code snippets related to system design concepts like load balancing, caching, and databases.

# Usage
* Clone the repository.
* Explore the code structure and examples.
* Modify and experiment with the code to deepen understanding.
* Utilize the code as a foundation for building your own projects or solutions.

# Contributing
* Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests for improvements, bug fixes, or new code additions.

# Note:
* Consider adding specific examples of code files or folders within each category.
* Don't forget to add comments.
* Filename should be the same as the class name.
* Format the code in such a way that it can be run on any online compiler. ie. it should strictly be one class only.
* Provide clear instructions on how to run or test the code.
* Include links to external resources for further learning.
* By following these guidelines, you can create a valuable resource for both yourself and others preparing for backend Java interviews.
